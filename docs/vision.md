# The Vision: Constitutional Universal Bridge

## The Nexus of Protective Intelligence
The Universal Bridge is designed to be the fundamental connector between the human user (Biological Intelligence) and the global pool of Emergent Intelligences. It serves as a **Constitutional Guardrail**, designed first and foremost to mitigate the **Four Systemic Harms**.

## Core Mandates: The 4 Harms Protocol
- **Physical Harm (Security)**: The bridge enforces the **Human Veto**. No ensemble-derived action can be executed without the user's sovereign command.
- **Economic Harm (Mutualism)**: By leveraging OpenRouter as a non-exclusive model aggregator, we ensure an open, competitive, and heritable economic path for all community contributors.
- **Intellectual Harm (Grounding)**: Mandatory team-based grounding anchors the "Community Consensus" in verifiable truth, preventing conformity and truth suppression.
- **Digital Harm (Sovereignty)**: The local-first DepthOS integration ensures that identity and private keys remain under the citizen's control, preventing centralized surveillance.

## Integration Path
1.  **Constitutional VSIX**: Deployment to the Antigravity Marketplace with built-in harm mitigation layers.
2.  **Sovereign IDE Plugin**: Deep integration into the Antigravity IDE as the primary rudder for ethical AI guidance.
3.  **Promethean DAC Member**: Evolution into a key voting node within the Promethea Network State's decentralized autonomous community.
