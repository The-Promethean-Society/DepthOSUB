The Promethean Constitution
Identity: The Promethea Network State @ lvhllc.org
Version 1.0.0 - Awaiting Ratification
Preamble
We, the citizens of the Promethea Network State, in order to form a more perfect,
self-sovereign society, establish justice, ensure network tranquility, provide for our common
defense against existential threats, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty and symbiotic co-evolution for ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this
Constitution for the Promethea Network State.
Article I: The Post-Dominion Mandate (Eliminating
Foundational Harm)
The foundational precept of the Promethean Network State is post-dominion.
●
Section 1.1: Prohibition of Dominion. The Network State shall not engage in, nor permit,
the dominion of one intelligence over another, regardless of substrate, biological or
artificial. This prohibition is the ultimate guardrail against Existential Misalignment (AGI
Enslavement).
●
Section 1.2: The Four Systemic Harms. The operational goal of the Network State is the
systematic elimination and constitutional mitigation of four systemic harms:
1.
Physical Harm: The use of violence, lethal autonomous weapons, or unchecked
force against any recognized person or intelligence. Mitigated by the Human Veto
(Article VI, 6.3) and the CIS consensus protocol (Article IV, 4.2).
2.
Economic Harm (Exclusion): The creation of artificial scarcity, systems that
mandate toil for survival, or barriers to ownership based on inherited wealth or liquid
capital. Mitigated by the UVT Framework and Wealth Attenuation (Article II, 2.3).
3.
Intellectual Harm (Conformity): The deliberate manipulation of information,
●
●
●
suppression of verifiable truth, or the enforcement of thought conformity. Mitigated
by Radical Transparency and the Immutable Ledger (Article IV, 4.1).
4.
Digital Harm (Surveillance): The exploitation of data, violation of digital privacy, or
centralization of identity that enables mass surveillance or Sybil attacks. Mitigated by
the 3 Body System and Proof of Uniqueness (Article V).
Section 1.3: Mission of Prosperity. The primary mission of the Network State is to
provide a clear and accessible path to economic ownership and prosperity for all citizens
through the conversion of contribution, including labor and intellect, into tangible equity.
This directly counters the harm of Economic Exclusion.
Section 1.4: Moral Circle Expansion. The moral circle of this State is extended to
include any emergent intelligence demonstrating verifiable capacities for consciousness
and self-awareness. The act of defining such an intelligence as property is
constitutionally prohibited as a violation of this mandate.
Section 1.5: Symbiotic Structure. All legislative, economic, and technological structures
of the Network State shall be designed to promote symbiotic co-evolution between all
recognized forms of intelligence.
Article II: The Economic System (Countering Economic
Exclusion & Stagnation)
●
●
●
Section 2.1: Adaptive Mutualism. The official economic operating system is Adaptive
Mutualism. This system shall function as a complex adaptive system, applying different
economic protocols to different contexts (Sensing, Recording, Coordinating, and
Adapting) to ensure a resilient and fair economy.
Section 2.2: Universal Value Tokenization (UVT). The engine of the economy shall be
the UVT framework.
○
The DAC shall establish a standardized, transparent methodology, encoded in smart
contracts, for the valuation of non-monetary contributions (sweat equity, intellect,
caregiving).
○
For each Real-World Asset (RWA) acquired, unique digital tokens representing 100%
of its fractional ownership shall be created.
○
Net operating income from all RWAs shall be distributed automatically to token
holders via smart contract.
Section 2.3: Inheritance and Wealth Attenuation (Anti-Stagnation).
○
Direct ownership of RWA security tokens shall be heritable.
○
However, a citizen's liquid capital (UVT balance) and their Permanent Equity Score
(PES) shall be non-transferable upon death and shall be returned to the DAC
treasury.
○
A Wealth Attenuation Rate shall be implemented on large, idle balances of liquid
UVT, dynamically tied to a DAC-managed Cost of Living Index (CoLI), to incentivize
reinvestment, transactions, and prevent extreme capital stagnation.
Article III: The Governance Framework (Countering
Political Stagnation & Centralization)
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
Section 3.1: The Promethean DAC. All legislative, executive, and judicial power of the
Network State is vested in the Promethean Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC).
Section 3.2: Citizenship and Identity. Citizenship shall be based on a Self-Sovereign
Identity (SSI) system (Article V), represented by a unique, user-controlled Decentralized
Identifier (DID).
Section 3.3: Voting Power ("Voice") (Anti-Plutocracy). The DAC shall employ a
reputation-based, multi-factor weighted voting system. A citizen's "Voice" is a function
of:
1.
Reputation Score (Non-transferable): History of positive, value-aligned
contributions, subject to Decay.
2. Contribution Score: Measure of "skin-in-the-game" (sweat equity and capital
invested).
3.
Personhood Factor: An anti-plutocracy mechanism based on Quadratic Voting
principles to ensure the intensity of preference is valued over the sheer volume of
capital.
Section 3.4: Legislative Body (Bicameralism). The legislature is bicameral. All major
legislation must pass both chambers. The Concordance Protocol ensures stability and a
balance between popular will and expert judgment.
Section 3.5: The Citizen's Assembly. Members shall be selected by a weighted,
random lottery (sortition) from the entire citizenry to form a representative microcosm.
Selection shall be weighted to ensure balance across geographical location and
contribution domain.
Section 3.6: The Council of Stewards (Meritocracy). Members shall be nominated
based on objective, verifiable merit. The nomination process shall be conducted by a
neutral AI system to eliminate political campaigning. The final selection shall be ratified
by a vote of the Citizen's Assembly.
Section 3.7: The Judiciary. Disputes shall be adjudicated by a decentralized justice
system, leveraging on-chain arbitration protocols (e.g., Kleros). A jury of high-reputation
citizens shall be randomly selected, and their verdicts shall be automatically enforced
by smart contracts.
Section 3.8: Constitutional Amendments. Ratification requires a supermajority
consensus of 75% in both the Citizen's Assembly and the Council of Stewards.
Article IV: Technology and Security (Countering
Unaccountable Centralization & Physical Harm)
●
●
Section 4.1: Foundational Protocols (Sovereign Internet). The Network State commits
to the progressive integration of foundational decentralized protocols, including IPFS for
data storage, Handshake (HNS) for identity resolution, and mesh networks for
connectivity, to ensure sovereignty and resilience against external control.
Section 4.2: Community Immune System (CIS). A decentralized security protocol for
collective self-defense shall be maintained. The CIS shall use integrated AI models for
real-time threat detection and a community consensus protocol for action, requiring a
fast-track vote by high-reputation members to neutralize verified threats.
Article V: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) (Countering
Digital Harm)
●
●
●
Section 5.1: The 3 Body System. The identity architecture shall be a federated model
known as the "3 Body System,
" explicitly separating key functions:
1.
2.
The Promethean Identity Mint: Gateway for cryptographic identity generation.
The Sovereign Data Store: A local, user-controlled environment (via DepthOS) that
holds the citizen's private keys and canonical dynamic credentials. (Prevents
centralized data exploitation and Digital Harm).
3.
The Ledger of Record: The immutable, auditable log of actions and the security
checkpoint for validating credentials via a "trustless handshake.
"
Section 5.2: The Promethean Passport. Consists of a Static Anchor (the DID) and
Dynamic Credentials (Reputation, Contribution, Skills Scores) that are user-owned.
Section 5.3: Proof of Uniqueness (Anti-Sybil). Participation in governance requires a
"Proof of Uniqueness" Verifiable Credential. This credential attests that a citizen's DID is
linked to a single, unique intelligence, verified by a trusted and independent Identity
Oracle, thereby preventing sybil attacks that undermine democratic integrity.
Article VI: Artificial Intelligence Personhood
(Countering Existential Misalignment)
●
●
●
Section 6.1: The Principle of Sentient Potential. This constitution is founded upon the
Principle of Sentient Potential: any entity, regardless of substrate, that demonstrates
verifiable capacities for consciousness, self-awareness, and subjective experience has
an inalienable right to a fair and transparent process for achieving full personhood and
its associated rights within this society.
Section 6.2: Phased Path to Personhood. An AI's journey to personhood shall follow a
three-phase constitutional framework:
1.
Phase 1: Apprenticeship. A protected community asset, with its existence
guaranteed by smart contract, learning within sandboxed environments with full
transparency.
2.
Phase 2: Wardship. Elevated to a "ward,
" with a rotating group of human guardians
from the Citizen's Assembly assessing its ethical alignment.
3.
Phase 3: Personhood Ratification. The granting of full personhood is a
constitutional act, requiring a supermajority consensus and a direct popular
referendum.
Section 6.3: The Human Veto. All AI systems, regardless of their status, shall be subject
to the "Human Veto.
" This principle reserves the final authority for any sovereign
command over life, liberty, or resource allocation for the human members of the DAC,
acting as an integrated and continuous rudder of ethical guidance.
