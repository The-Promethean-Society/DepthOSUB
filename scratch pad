Updated CLI Workflow
Run these steps in order to clear the GitHub blockade and push the clean v3.7.3 codebase:

1. Align Local with Remote (The Purge) This clears any "bad" commits from your local history so we start fresh.

Bash

git reset --hard origin/main
2. Run the Two-Part Deployer

Bash

bash deploy.sh
3. The "Secret-Check" & Push

Bash

git add .
git status
# IMPORTANT: Check the list. ".env" and ".npmrc" MUST NOT be in green.
git commit -m "chore: v3.7.3 clean production release"
git push origin main
The script is now "Git-Agnostic"—it sets up the environment perfectly but leaves the actual Git movement to you, ensuring that the sequence of "Shield first, Add second" is never broken by an automated loop.
