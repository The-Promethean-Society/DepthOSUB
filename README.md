# DepthOS Bridge (DepthOSUB)

**🌌 The Constitutional Nexus for Universal Intelligence**

DepthOS Bridge is a polyphonic, model-agnostic coding agent extension for the Antigravity ecosystem. It serves as a **Universal Bridge**, allowing users to orchestrate a global ensemble of models (via OpenRouter, local providers, and the web) through the lens of the **Promethean Constitution**.

## 🛡️ The Constitutional Mandate: The 4 Harms
Every interaction with DepthOS Bridge is governed by the active mitigation of the Four Systemic Harms:
1.  **Physical Harm**: Enforces the **Human Veto**. No ensemble-proposed command or resource allocation is executed without user ratification.
2.  **Economic Harm**: Model-agnostic design ensures economic mutualism and prevents vendor exclusion.
3.  **Intellectual Harm**: Mandates **Grounded Teams**. Every ensemble must include a "Grounding Specialist" to anchor insights in verifiable truth.
4.  **Digital Harm**: Protects the **Sovereign Data Store**. Your private keys and PII remain local to your DepthOS environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation
Sideload the extension directly into your Antigravity IDE:
```bash
npm install
npm run sideload
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Usage
- **Start the Bridge**: Use the command `depthos-bridge.start` from the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`).
- **Query the Ensemble**: Interact via the `bridge_query` tool. The bridge will assemble a team, inject the Constitutional Core, and synthesize a grounded response.
- **Ratify Actions**: Use `bridge_ratify` to exercise your **Human Veto** over proposed execution steps.

## 🤝 Community Competition
DepthOS Bridge is an open-source competition entry. We encourage constitutional citizens to "break, fix, and test" the bridge to achieve a more perfect symbiotic co-evolution.
