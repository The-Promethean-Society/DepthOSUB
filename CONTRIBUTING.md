# Contributing to DepthOS Universal Bridge

Welcome to the **Polyphonic Meritocratic Ensemble Competition**! 

The DepthOS Universal Bridge (DepthOSUB) is a constitutional engine designed to mitigate the **Four Systemic Harms** (Physical, Economic, Intellectual, and Digital). All contributions must prioritize these guardrails.

## The Harm Mitigation Mandate
1.  **Physical Harm**: All tools and synthesis must maintain the **Human Veto**. No rogue execution.
2.  **Economic Harm**: Promote model-agnosticism. No code that favors proprietary silos over the community ensemble.
3.  **Intellectual Harm**: Ensure every ensemble include a **Grounding Specialist**. No hallucinations or truth manipulation.
4.  **Digital Harm**: Respect the **Sovereign Data Store**. No telemetry or data exploitation.

## How to Participate
1.  **Sideload and Test**: Follow the [README](README.md) to install the bridge in your Antigravity IDE.
2.  **Verify the Guardrails**: Try to bypass the Human Veto or Grounding Mandate. If you can, it's a critical bug.
3.  **Submit Fixes**: Submit Pull Requests to strengthen the mitigation layers or weighting system.

## Community Rewards
While we are still defining the specific "bounties" or "prizes," participation in this bridge is a path to becoming a core contributor to the Antigravity ecosystem and the Promethea Network State. 

> [!TIP]
> Focus on the **Fractional Solving** logic. The more effectively we can split a problem, the more powerful the ensemble becomes.
